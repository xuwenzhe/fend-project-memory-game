## Installation

Feel free to clone my repo and open "index.html" file in your browser.

## How to play

There are 8 pairs of cards. Each pair has its unique symbol. Gamers are expected to flip two different cards in a row, which is a "move" operation. 

If these two cards match, both of them will get revealed. 
Otherwise, both of them will go back to uncovered status. 

To win the game, you need to reveal all 8 pairs of cards. 

A restart button is designed for restart the game. A timer is provided to show the time usage. Gamers' performance is based on both total number of moves and time usage. Gamers get 3 stars when they win the game within 15 moves, 2 stars with 15-30 moves, and 1 star for over 30 moves. 

Good luck and have fun!

## Contributing

This is a project in Udacity Front-end Nanodegree Program. A static version with some HTML and CSS styling of this game is provided by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game). The objective of this project is to convert this static version to an interactive one. Most of my work is in `js/app.js`.

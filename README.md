## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Game Rules
There are 8 pairs of cards. Each pair has its unique symbol. Gamers are expected to flip two different cards in a row, which is called a "move" operation. If these two cards match, both of them will get revealed. Otherwise, both of them will go back to uncovered status. Your job is to reveal all 8 pairs of cards. A restart button is designed for reset the game. A timer is provided to show the time usage. Gamers' performance is based on both total number of moves and time usage. Gamers get 3 stars when they win the game within 15 moves, 2 stars with 15-30 moves, and 1 star for over 30 moves. Good luck and have fun!
